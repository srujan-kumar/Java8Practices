/* Ref from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-minimum-swap-to-make-string-palindrome/

Time Complexity: O(n2)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Approach: Check whether it is possible to make a palindrome or not from the given string. As we know that if more than one character in a string occurs an odd number of times that string canâ€™t be a palindrome.
If palindrome is not possible then return -1.
Take two pointers left pointing to the 0th index and a right pointer pointing to the last index to the given string
Do the following until left pointer is less than right pointer:
Fix the left pointer and move a copy of right pointer say r, to right side to search element which is similar to character pointing by left pointer.
If the left pointer is equal to r pointer, it means this is an odd occurring character that we have to move at the middle of the string.
 So swap character at r index to its next index (move character toward right side)
Increment result by 1 for this swap operation.
Otherwise,
Swap the found character at r to right side, until it reaches at right index and keeps incrementing the result for the swap operation.
Increment left by 1 and decrement right by 1.

Example: Input: aabcb
Output: 3
Explanation:
After 1st swap: abacb
After 2nd swap: abcab
After 3rd swap: abcba

Input: adbcdbad
Output: -1
